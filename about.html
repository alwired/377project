                As a student, it's frustrating to be on the waitlist for a course.
                The reasons for this vary- some departments have problems with finding enough professors, and some may just have more classes popular with nonmajor students.

                Since I use a single-value metric, it's logical to use a bar chart to visualize these differences using charts from the Highcharts library.
                The purpose of visualizing this data is to bring attention to the worst-offending majors to help inform decisions for both students and administrators.
