### Info
As a student, it's frustrating to be on the waitlist for a course. The reasons for this vary- some departments have problems with finding enough professors, and some may just have more classes popular with nonmajor students. The goal of this project is to get some objective measurement of how hard it is to get into a course for a certain major at the University of Maryland. I do this by taking the difference between open seats and waitlisted students across a major, and divide that by total available seats to help control for department size for a more accurate comparison. Since I use a single-value metric, it's logical to use a bar chart to visualize these differences using charts from the Highcharts library. The purpose of visualizing this data is to bring attention to the worst-offending majors to help inform decisions for both students and administrators. If you're a student and on the fence between two majors, you might take a look at this list and decide to pick the one that allows you to be more likely to graduate on time. If you're a UMD administrator, you may want to consider reallocating resources to or from some of the departments in this chart. Data is collected from https://beta.umd.io/, which has information about all course sections.
