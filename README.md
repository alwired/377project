### Description
API: https://beta.umd.io/  
JS libraries: Highcharts 11.0.1  
CSS frameworks: Bulma 0.9.4  

The goal of this project is to compare the difference between open seats and waitlisted students across UMD majors. Since I use a single-value metric, it's logical to use a bar chart to visualize these differences using charts from the Highcharts library.

Some majors have problems with finding an adequate number of professors. The purpose of visualizing this data is to bring attention to the worst-offending majors to help inform decisions for both students and administrators.
